# Apptellect-Suite
Working on it...
It's a PHP project I'm developing to manage property affairs efficiently. Users can handle tasks like housing, apartment complexes, dorms, and rentals. They can create groups for bulk actions, such as notifying tenants about maintenance schedules. Owners can collect rent or maintenance fees via UPI recurring payments or tenant billing. The system includes panels for owners, admins, tenants, and employees for separate access. I have many more features in mind that are yet to be implemented but you can view them in Screenshots below.
